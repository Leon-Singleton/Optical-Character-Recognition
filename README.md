# Optical-Character-Recognition-Python
An optical character recognition system for processing scanned book pages. Uses k nearest neighbour classification as a classifer with a feature vector of 10 dimensions to operate robustly even on low quality 'noisy' image data. Makes use of PCA for dimensionality reduction. Error correction implemented by looking at words most similar to those not correctly recognised and taking the closest matching word from the English dictionary.
